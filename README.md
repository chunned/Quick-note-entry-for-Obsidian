# QuickEntry
A simple Python script used to quickly add a new entry to your Daily Notes in the Obsidian notetaking tool (https://obsidian.md/).

After initial setup, simply run the program

**Note:** This program assumes your daily note files are named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. 

# Getting Started

1. Open the QuickEntry.py file in a text editor or IDE. 
2. **Navigate to line 6.** Enter the path to the directory where you store your daily notes in between the quotation marks. **Note: if you use Windows, change all \ to /** - so `C:\Path\to\vault` becomes `C:/Path/to/vault`
3. **Navigate to lines 28-31.** Choose which folder naming convention you use.

That's it! If you want to make running the program more convenient, you can either add it to your system PATH environment variable, or use a keyboard shortcut to automatically launch it.
